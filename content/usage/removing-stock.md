# Removing Stock Items

Learn how to delete items from your inventory.

## Navigation

From the home page, tap the **"Update Stock"** button to access this page.

## Steps to Delete an Item

### 1. Find the Item

Scroll through the list of items to find the one you want to delete.

### 2. Delete the Item

1. Tap the **delete icon (🗑️)** on the right side of the item
2. The item will be immediately removed from the database
3. The list will automatically refresh

⚠️ **Warning:** Deletion is permanent and cannot be undone!

## Quick Quantity Updates

You can also quickly update quantities without going to the Update Stock page:

1. Go to **Check Stock** page
2. Find the item in the list
3. Use the **+** or **-** buttons to increase/decrease quantity
4. Changes are saved immediately

## Best Practices

- Double-check before deleting items

- Keep a backup of important inventory data

### What Went Wrong (Individual Level)
- I didn't use AI effectively which created design issues and code smell.
- Documentation for PocketBase confused me and made it difficult to implement without help from AI.
- Not all goals for sprint 1 were met by the deadline
- Some of the features I had planned did not fit within the scope of the project.

---

### What Went Well (Individual Level):
- CRUD operations are working really well and pocketbase is much easier to work with now.
- The UI is intuitive and does the job effectively.
- Core functions are working perfectly.
- Working with AI has helped me focus more on what I wanted the project to look like and do.
- I have made the project more consise and refactored code that AI had provided to fit my design.

---

### Analysis & Improvement Plan (Individual Level):
- I plan to work more diligently with this assignment and will have the project as my main focus
- Read more about integrating pocketbase and creating better user experience.
- Create more specific goals to obtain to track progress easier.
- Create more tests to ensure my app works in all cases.
- Work with Cursor's plan mode to build off of the app I have to keep focus on better features.
